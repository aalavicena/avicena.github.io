# Welcome!
I am Naufal, a Master's student at Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the tutelage of Prof. Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz. My research interests span around human-wildlife conflict (HWC) and its AI applications, with a particular aim to inform evidence-based human-wildlife conflict mitigation. My current master's project aims to understand the drivers and predict future risks of elephant-caused human casualties in Tropical Asia, a globally exceptional yet under-recognized conservation issue.

During my BSc at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (subsequently a research associate here after graduation), I lead a project, within the Management and Ecology of Malaysian Elephants (MEME), on building a deep learning algorithm for a vocalization-based elephant early-warning system to mitigate human-elephant conflict at oil palm landscapes. Some notable publications stemmed from this project (see Publications section below) and the system is currently being prototyped in oil palm plantations across Johor, Malaysia. 

Trained as an ecologist, I have fieldwork experience across Malaysia's tropical forests: Belum-Temengor (Perak), Segari-Melintang (Perak), Endau-Rompin (Pahang), and Panti Forest Reserves (Johor). I was involved in a long-term behavioral study of the endangered pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) and bioacoustics studies (soundscapes and elephants).

I do not use social media that much (for my sanity), but you can find me on LinkedIn! or contact me directly through email: naufalrahmanavicena@gmail.com
